```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#load mtcars data
data(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
tail(mtcars)
boxplot(mpg ~ am, data=mtcars, main="Mileage by Transmission Type", ylab="MPG (Mile per Gallon)",
        col=c("lightgreen","lightblue"), names=c("automaitc", "manual"))
```
from the boxplot, we can see cars with manual transmission have on average much higher mpg. Also, more than 75% of cars with manual transmission have higher mpg than 75% of cars with automaitc transmission. It is quite apparent. However, we will investigate how other factors such as displacement, number of cylinder and etc are influencing this.
